## Project 'Awesome Body Tracker'


This app allows you to keep a daily log of different body part measures. So you can keep a log and track every item to hit your target.

You can see charts of your overall progress (by default it shows you biceps and triceps on the Progress tab) and also a detailed view of every record when you go to the Bodypart section.

This app is built with React for the frontend and It hits an API endpoint built with Rails that you can find [here](www.github.com/alexawesomecode/awesome-body-api/)
